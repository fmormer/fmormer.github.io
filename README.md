# Morie Analytics  
## Integrated Anchor & Seabed Intelligence for Floating Offshore Wind

## Accelerating Scalable Floating Offshore Wind

Floating offshore wind is entering large-scale deployment in deep and ultra-deep waters across Europe and the other regions of the world. As lease areas expand into more complex seabed conditions, the engineering challenges of anchoring, mooring, and installation grow significantly.

Morie Analytics provides an integrated, data-driven framework to optimize floating wind foundations, mooring systems, and installation strategies — reducing cost, uncertainty, and engineering fragmentation.

## The Engineering Gap

Current industry workflows remain fragmented:

- Hydrodynamic simulations are performed separately from geotechnical capacity analysis  
- Anchor selection is often heuristic and conservative  
- Extreme, cyclic, and installation capacity are evaluated in isolation  
- Soil variability is not fully integrated into farm-level optimization  
- Installation methodology is disconnected from early-stage anchor design  

This fragmentation leads to:
- Overdesigned anchors  
- Inefficient layouts  
- Increased steel mass and CAPEX  
- Installation risk exposure  
- Delayed investment decisions  
- Excesive design iterations

Floating wind requires fundamentally different from the current engineering tools with an unified approach.

- Soil variability mapping and CPT strategy

### 2. Anchor Intelligence Engine
- Extreme and cyclic capacity evaluation  
- Installation feasibility modeling  
- Layered soil profile integration  
- Comparative assessment of anchor types (suction, driven, torpedo, etc.)  

### 3. Mooring & Cable Optimization
- Coupled mooring-anchor performance assessment  
- Layout optimization under bathymetric constraints  
- Sensitivity analysis across load envelopes
- Dynamic cable design  

### 4. Installation & Cost Modeling
