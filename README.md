### For Floating Offshore Wind and Marine Energy Converters

## Enabling Scalable Floating Renewable Energy

Floating offshore wind and marine energy converters (wave and tidal systems) are expanding into deeper waters and more complex seabed environments worldwide.

As projects move from pilot arrays to commercial-scale deployment, engineering challenges become system-level problems:

- Mooring line performance  
- Anchor capacity and installation  
- Dynamic cable integrity  
- Seabed variability  
- Installation logistics  
- Cost sensitivity across the full floating system  

Morie Analytics provides an integrated, data-driven framework to optimize the entire mooring and subsea infrastructure workflow — reducing uncertainty, cost, and excessive design iteration.

## The Engineering Gap

Current engineering workflows remain fragmented:

- Hydrodynamic simulations are separated from geotechnical capacity evaluation  
- Mooring lines, anchors, and dynamic cables are optimized independently  
- Extreme, cyclic, and fatigue limit states are treated in isolation  
- Soil variability is not fully integrated into system-level optimization  
- Installation methodology is disconnected from early design decisions  
- Cable routing rarely incorporates seabed-informed risk modeling  

This fragmentation leads to:

- Conservative and overdesigned systems  
- Repeated redesign loops between disciplines  
- Inefficient layout decisions  
- Increased steel mass and material usage  
- Installation risk exposure  
- Escalating CAPEX and schedule uncertainty  

Floating renewable energy requires a unified, system-level engineering approach.
